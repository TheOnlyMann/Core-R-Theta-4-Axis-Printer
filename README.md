4 Axis Polar 3D Printer

This is my 4 axis, polar, "core-RΘ" 3D printer – an entirely new type of multi axis 3D printer designed from the ground up.

Check out my [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEgwnhLHy3g) to see it in action!

### Slicer

A multi axis printer is pretty hopeless without a non-planar slicer, which is why I built this quick [radial slicer](https://github.com/jyjblrd/Radial_Non_Planar_Slicer) for the printer. This leverages the printer's rotating nozzle to print simple parts without supports, but there are some limitations to it which I cover in the YouTube video. I'm also working on an optimization based slicer which will be able to print any object without support so stay tuned for that!

### Assembly

You can view the [3d model online](https://a360.co/3VdXkRY) to see how to assemble the printer. Everything is 3D printable, however I got the extruder mount made out of metal by JLCPCB as there is quite a bit of torque on that part. I've also included the gerber files to make your own PCB buildplate, but a sheet of MDF wood would also work.
